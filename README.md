# body_paint

This is the code for a demo of a body-paint task for a psychological study.
The body-paint task itself is written as a jsPsych plugin ([tutorial here](https://www.jspsych.org/tutorials/hello-world/)),
and the app running the task is in [https://nodejs.org/](node.js).

The jsPsych plugin is jspsych/plugins/jspsych-paint-d3.js and the experiment script is public/views/experiment.ejs
